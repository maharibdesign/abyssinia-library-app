  <p>Getting rich is not just about luck; it's about becoming the kind of person who can create wealth. It's about finding and building specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.</p>
  <p>Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you. It's found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.</p>
