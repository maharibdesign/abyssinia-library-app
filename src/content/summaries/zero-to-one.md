Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, argues that the next great innovators will not copy existing models (going from 1 to n), but will create something entirely new (going from 0 to 1). He contends that true innovation comes from escaping competition, not winning it. The book explores how to build companies that create new things and advises founders to think for themselves and question conventional wisdom.
