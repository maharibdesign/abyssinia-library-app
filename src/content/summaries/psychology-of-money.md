Housel explains that financial success is less about what you know and more about how you behave. Using engaging stories, he shows that personal finance is deeply personal and emotional. The key to building wealth isn't complex financial knowledge, but rather discipline, patience, and understanding that your own behavior is the biggest factor. True wealth is having the freedom to make your own choices.
