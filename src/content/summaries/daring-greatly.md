Based on years of research, Brown asserts that vulnerability is not a weakness but our most accurate measure of courage. She argues that we can only find true connection, love, and purpose when we 'dare greatly' by stepping into the arena and allowing ourselves to be seen. The book provides a powerful new vision for letting go of fear and shame to live a more wholehearted life.
