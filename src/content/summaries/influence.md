Cialdini explains the psychology of why people say 'yes' and how to apply these understandings. He outlines six key principles of persuasion: Reciprocity, Commitment and Consistency, Social Proof, Liking, Authority, and Scarcity. By understanding these mental shortcuts, we can become more skilled persuaders and also defend ourselves against manipulation.
