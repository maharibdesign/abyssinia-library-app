Ries proposes a scientific approach to creating and managing startups. Instead of elaborate business plans, entrepreneurs should focus on a 'Build-Measure-Learn' feedback loop. The goal is to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere. This method reduces waste and helps companies build what customers actually want.
