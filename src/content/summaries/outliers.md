Gladwell challenges the idea that success is solely based on individual merit. He argues that high-achievers, or 'outliers,' benefit from a unique combination of circumstances, opportunities, cultural legacy, and hard work (like the '10,000-Hour Rule'). The book explores the hidden advantages and arbitrary rules that shape who succeeds and who doesn't.
