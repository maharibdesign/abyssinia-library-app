Tolle argues that our minds create most of our suffering by dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. The path to inner peace lies in accessing the present moment. He teaches how to quiet the 'inner voice,' dis-identify from the ego, and embrace the now. By doing so, we can transcend pain and find a deep, lasting sense of joy and fulfillment.
