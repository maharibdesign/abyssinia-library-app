Manson argues that the relentless pursuit of positivity is what makes us unhappy. Instead, we should learn to embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties. True happiness comes not from avoiding problems, but from solving them. The book encourages us to choose which struggles we are willing to endure and to care only about what is truly important and meaningful.
