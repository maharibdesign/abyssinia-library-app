In a totalitarian superstate known as Oceania, the Party, led by the omnipresent Big Brother, controls every aspect of human life. The novel follows Winston Smith, a low-ranking member of the Party who begins to question the regime and its manipulation of history and language ('Newspeak'). It's a chilling warning about the consequences of government overreach, censorship, and the loss of truth.
