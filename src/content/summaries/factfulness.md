Rosling reveals the ten instincts that distort our perspective of the world, from our tendency to divide the world into 'us' and 'them' to how we consume media. He demonstrates that despite these instincts, the world is, for the most part, in a much better state than we think. He provides a framework for 'factfulness' to help us overcome our biases and see the world as it really is.
