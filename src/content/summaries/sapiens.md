Harari argues that Homo sapiens came to dominate the world through our unique ability to believe in shared fictions, such as money, laws, and gods. This cognitive revolution allowed for large-scale, flexible cooperation, enabling us to build cities, nations, and global empires. The book traces how agricultural and scientific revolutions further shaped our societies and asks what the future may hold for our species.
