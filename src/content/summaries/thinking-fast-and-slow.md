Nobel laureate Kahneman explains the two systems of thought: System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and logical. He reveals the extraordinary capabilities, as well as the faults and biases, of fast thinking. By understanding how these two systems shape our judgments and decisions, we can learn to identify and mitigate common cognitive errors.
