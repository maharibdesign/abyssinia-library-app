Told through the eyes of a young girl, Scout Finch, the story follows her father, Atticus, a lawyer who defends a black man falsely accused of a crime. The novel explores themes of courage, prejudice, and the loss of innocence. Atticus Finch serves as a moral hero, teaching his children and the town about empathy, integrity, and standing up for what is right, even when it's unpopular.
