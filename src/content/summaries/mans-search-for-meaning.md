Frankl observes that those who survived the horrors of the Holocaust were often not the strongest physically, but those who maintained a sense of purpose and meaning. He argues that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful. We can find meaning in work, in love, or in the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.
