Trauma expert van der Kolk explains how traumatic stress literally rearranges the brain's wiring. He explores innovative treatments—from neurofeedback and meditation to sports and yoga—that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brain's natural neuroplasticity. The book shows how trauma is not just a memory, but a physical imprint on the body that must be addressed for true healing.
