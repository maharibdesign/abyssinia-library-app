Covey presents a holistic framework for effectiveness based on character ethics. The habits move from dependence to independence (Be Proactive, Begin with the End in Mind, Put First Things First) and then to interdependence (Think Win-Win, Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood, Synergize). The final habit, Sharpen the Saw, focuses on continuous self-renewal.
